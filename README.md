### About ###

[Simple Features GeoJSON](http://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-geojson-ios/) is an iOS Objective-C library for writing and reading [Simple Feature](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-ios) Geometries to and from GeoJSON.

### Usage ###

View the latest [Appledoc](http://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-geojson-ios/docs/api/)

#### Read ####

```objectivec

// NSString *content = ...

SFGGeometry *geometry = [SFGFeatureConverter jsonToGeometry:content];
SFGeometry *simpleGeometry = [geometry geometry];

/* Read as a generic GeoJSON object, Feature, or Feature Collection */
// SFGGeoJSONObject *geoJSONObject = [SFGFeatureConverter jsonToObject:content];
// SFGFeature *feature = [SFGFeatureConverter jsonToFeature:content];
// SFGFeatureCollection *featureCollection = [SFGFeatureConverter jsonToFeatureCollection:content];

```

#### Write ####

```objectivec

// SFGeometry *geometry = ...

NSString *content = [SFGFeatureConverter simpleGeometryToJSON:geometry];

SFGFeature *feature = [SFGFeatureConverter simpleGeometryToFeature:geometry];
NSString *featureContent = [SFGFeatureConverter objectToJSON:feature];

SFGFeatureCollection *featureCollection = [SFGFeatureConverter simpleGeometryToFeatureCollection:geometry];
NSString *featureCollectionContent = [SFGFeatureConverter objectToJSON:featureCollection];

NSDictionary *contentTree = [SFGFeatureConverter simpleGeometryToTree:geometry];

```

#### Read ####

```swift

// var content: String = ...

let geometry: SFGGeometry = SFGFeatureConverter.json(toGeometry: content)
let simpleGeometry: SFGeometry = geometry.geometry()

/* Read as a generic GeoJSON object, Feature, or Feature Collection */
// let geoJSONObject : SFGGeoJSONObject = SFGFeatureConverter.json(toObject: content)
// let feature: SFGFeature = SFGFeatureConverter.json(toFeature: content)
// let featureCollection : SFGFeatureCollection = SFGFeatureConverter.json(toFeatureCollection: content)

```

#### Write ####

```swift

// let geometry : SFGeometry = ...

let content : String = SFGFeatureConverter.simpleGeometry(toJSON: geometry)

let feature : SFGFeature = SFGFeatureConverter.simpleGeometry(toFeature: geometry)
let featureContent : String = SFGFeatureConverter.object(toJSON: feature)

let featureCollection : SFGFeatureCollection = SFGFeatureConverter.simpleGeometry(toFeatureCollection: geometry)
let featureCollectionContent : String = SFGFeatureConverter.object(toJSON: featureCollection)

let contentTree : Dictionary = SFGFeatureConverter.simpleGeometry(toTree: geometry)

```
